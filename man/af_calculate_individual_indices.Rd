\title{Calculate Individual-Level Extremism Indices}
\usage{
af_calculate_individual_indices(df, dimensions)
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{A data frame containing the survey data with dimension scores and population indices.
Must contain columns specified in dimensions parameter and population threshold columns
(cnp_p, bnp_p, snp_p, onp_p, cep_p, bep_p, sep_p, oep_p).}

\item{dimensions}{Character vector of exactly 3 variable names corresponding to
cognitive, behavioral, and social dimensions. Default is c("pe_ideology", "pe_violence", "pe_intolerance").}
}
\value{
The input data frame with added individual-level indices:
\item{i_cel, i_bel, i_sel, i_oel}{Binary indicators (0/1) for whether individual exceeds
cognitive, behavioral, social, or overall extremism thresholds}
\item{i_cri, i_bri, i_sri, i_ori}{Relative extremism indices - individual's score divided by
the population normative point for cognitive, behavioral, social, and overall dimensions}
\item{i_er1, i_er2, i_er3}{Binary indicators for exceeding 1+, 2+, or all 3 dimension thresholds}
}
\description{
This function calculates individual-level extremism indicators for each person in the dataset,
including binary extremism flags, relative extremism indices, and multi-dimensional extremism ranks.
All individuals are compared against population thresholds and normative points.
}
\details{
The function performs row-wise calculations to:
\itemize{
\item Compare each individual's scores to population extremism thresholds
\item Calculate relative intensity by dividing scores by population normative points
\item Count how many dimensions exceed thresholds for multi-dimensional extremism ranks
}

Missing values in dimensions or thresholds result in NA for that individual's indices.
The pe_overall column must exist in the data frame for overall calculations.

\examples{
# Assuming df already has dimension scores and population indices from af_gauge_indices
df_with_individual <- af_calculate_individual_indices(
  df = result_df,
  dimensions = c("pe_ideology", "pe_violence", "pe_intolerance")
)
