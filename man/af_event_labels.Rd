\arguments{
\item{p}{A ggplot object to which event labels will be added}
}

This function adds predefined event labels at specific x-axis positions to an existing ggplot object.
The labels are positioned at the bottom of the plot and include major events such as "Inland Terror",
"Bennet Gov. Fall", "Judicial Reform", "Galant Dismissal", and "October 7".

The function adds five event labels at x-positions 1.5, 2.5, 3.5, 4.5, and 5.5.
Labels are displayed in dark red color and positioned below the x-axis. The plot margins
are expanded to accommodate the labels, and clipping is turned off to ensure visibility.
